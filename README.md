# SAT Solving WS20/21 - Tents and Trees

## Information
(Authors: Marcel Baur, Elena Liebl, Bea Sax)

This is our repository for the first assignment of the SAT course. It contains a solver and generator for the Tents and
Trees puzzle written in C++.

## Building and using the project

### Building
The project can be built with a standard CMake build process. Development was done with the latest version of the `CLion`
IDE (Version 2020.3 at time of writing).

### Predefined puzzle
Predefined puzzles can be parsed into the `Field` object by calling the `generateFromFile(path)` function, which takes
the relative path to the `.txt` file as an input. It has to be formatted according to the assignment specification.

### Generate a new puzzle
A new puzzle can be generated by calling the `generate(r, c)` function, which will create a new game field with `r` rows
and `c` columns. The amount of trees for this puzzle is calculated as follows: `(c + r) * ((c+r)/20)`.

### Solving the puzzle
Once a puzzle has been generated or parsed, it can be solved (if possible!) by calling the `solve()` function. The solver
implements a basic backtracking algorithm.
